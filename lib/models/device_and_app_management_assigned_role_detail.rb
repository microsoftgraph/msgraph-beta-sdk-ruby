        # The DeviceAndAppManagementAssignedRoleDetail is a complex type in Microsoft Intune used to represent the Role Definitions and Permissions that are assigned to a specific user. This type provides a detailed view of the roles a user holds, along with the associated permissions that determine the specific actions the user can perform within Intune environment.
